The rules define how the elements should be displayed, such as setting the background color or font size. Multiple CSS rules can be applied to the same HTML element, and the rules are applied in a specific order, which is known as the 'cascading' aspect of CSS.\n Overall, CSS is an essential tool for web developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites."
